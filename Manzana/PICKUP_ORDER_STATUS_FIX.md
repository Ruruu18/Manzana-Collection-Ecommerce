# Pickup Order Status Fix

## 🐛 Problem

Your app is for **PICKUP orders**, not shipping orders. But the database had shipping-related status values:
- ❌ `'shipped'` → This means "sent for delivery"
- ❌ `'delivered'` → This means "arrived at customer's address"

This caused confusing notifications like:
> "Your order MZ-20251010-691 status has been updated to: **shipped**."

But customers aren't getting shipments - they're picking up orders!

## ✅ Solution

Changed status values to be pickup-friendly:
- ✅ `'ready'` (instead of 'shipped') → Order is ready for pickup
- ✅ `'completed'` (instead of 'delivered') → Customer picked up the order

## 📋 New Status Flow for Pickup Orders

```
pending → confirmed → processing → ready → completed
  ↓          ↓            ↓          ↓         ↓
Order    Staff      Preparing   Ready    Customer
placed  confirms    items       pickup   picked up
```

### Status Meanings:

| Status | What It Means | Notification |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| **pending** | Order just placed, waiting for staff to review | "✅ Order Placed Successfully!" |
| **confirmed** | Staff confirmed the order, will start preparing | "✅ Order Confirmed!" |
| **processing** | Staff is preparing/packing the items | "📦 Order Processing" |
| **ready** | Order is ready, customer can pick it up | "🎉 Order Ready for Pickup!" |
| **completed** | Customer picked up the order | "✨ Order Completed" |
| **cancelled** | Order was cancelled | "❌ Order Cancelled" |

## 🔧 How to Apply the Fix

### Step 1: Run SQL Migration

1. Open **Supabase Dashboard**: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Go to **SQL Editor**
3. Copy the entire contents of `fix-pickup-order-statuses.sql`
4. Paste and **Run**
5. You should see success message: "✅ Pickup order statuses updated successfully!"

This will:
- ✅ Update database constraint to allow 'ready' and 'completed' statuses
- ✅ Migrate existing orders: 'shipped' → 'ready', 'delivered' → 'completed'
- ✅ Update notification trigger with correct pickup messages
- ✅ Add pickup-specific columns (pickup_date, pickup_time, etc.)

### Step 2: Verify the Fix

```sql
-- Check that constraint was updated
SELECT conname, pg_get_constraintdef(oid)
FROM pg_constraint
WHERE conname = 'orders_status_check';

-- Should show: status IN ('pending', 'confirmed', 'processing', 'ready', 'completed', 'cancelled')
```

### Step 3: Test Notifications

```sql
-- Get a test order
SELECT id, order_number, status FROM orders LIMIT 1;

-- Update to 'ready' (should say "Ready for Pickup" not "Shipped")
UPDATE orders SET status = 'ready' WHERE id = 'your-order-id';

-- Check notification
SELECT title, message FROM notifications ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;

-- Expected:
-- Title: "🎉 Order Ready for Pickup!"
-- Message: "Your order MZ-... is ready! Please pick it up at your scheduled time..."
```

## 🎯 Before & After

### Before (Wrong - Shipping language):
```
Status: shipped
Notification: "Your order status has been updated to: shipped."
```
❌ Confusing! Customers aren't getting shipments.

### After (Correct - Pickup language):
```
Status: ready
Notification: "🎉 Order Ready for Pickup! Your order MZ-20251010-691 is ready!
Please pick it up at your scheduled time: Oct 10, 2025 at 2:00 PM."
```
✅ Clear! Customer knows exactly what to do.

## 💻 Code Changes

### TypeScript (Already Updated)

The `orderService.updateOrderStatus()` function now uses pickup statuses:

```typescript
// ✅ Correct status values for pickup orders
await orderService.updateOrderStatus(orderId, 'ready');      // Ready for pickup
await orderService.updateOrderStatus(orderId, 'completed');  // Picked up

// ❌ Old status values (no longer valid)
await orderService.updateOrderStatus(orderId, 'shipped');   // ERROR!
await orderService.updateOrderStatus(orderId, 'delivered'); // ERROR!
```

### Admin UI Example

```typescript
const OrderStatusButtons = ({ order }) => {
  return (
    <View>
      {order.status === 'pending' && (
        <Button
          title="✅ Confirm Order"
          onPress={() => orderService.updateOrderStatus(order.id, 'confirmed')}
        />
      )}

      {order.status === 'confirmed' && (
        <Button
          title="📦 Start Processing"
          onPress={() => orderService.updateOrderStatus(order.id, 'processing')}
        />
      )}

      {order.status === 'processing' && (
        <Button
          title="🎉 Mark Ready for Pickup"  {/* Changed from "Ship" */}
          onPress={() => orderService.updateOrderStatus(order.id, 'ready')}
        />
      )}

      {order.status === 'ready' && (
        <Button
          title="✨ Mark as Picked Up"  {/* Changed from "Delivered" */}
          onPress={() => orderService.updateOrderStatus(order.id, 'completed')}
        />
      )}
    </View>
  );
};
```

## 📊 Database Changes

### Old Schema:
```sql
status CHECK (status IN (
    'pending', 'confirmed', 'processing',
    'shipped',    -- ❌ Wrong for pickup
    'delivered',  -- ❌ Wrong for pickup
    'cancelled'
))
```

### New Schema:
```sql
status CHECK (status IN (
    'pending', 'confirmed', 'processing',
    'ready',      -- ✅ Correct for pickup
    'completed',  -- ✅ Correct for pickup
    'cancelled'
))
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Error: "new row violates check constraint"

**Problem**: Trying to use old status values ('shipped' or 'delivered')

**Solution**: Use new status values instead:
- Use `'ready'` instead of `'shipped'`
- Use `'completed'` instead of `'delivered'`

### Existing Orders Show Wrong Status

**Solution**: Run this query to fix them:

```sql
-- Fix all orders still using old status values
UPDATE orders SET status = 'ready' WHERE status = 'shipped';
UPDATE orders SET status = 'completed' WHERE status = 'delivered';
```

### Admin Panel Shows Old Status Labels

**Solution**: Update your admin UI to show correct labels:

```typescript
const STATUS_LABELS = {
  pending: 'Pending',
  confirmed: 'Confirmed',
  processing: 'Processing',
  ready: 'Ready for Pickup',     // ✅ Changed
  completed: 'Picked Up',         // ✅ Changed
  cancelled: 'Cancelled'
};
```

## ✅ Checklist

- [ ] Run `fix-pickup-order-statuses.sql` in Supabase
- [ ] Verify constraint updated (check SQL above)
- [ ] Test notification for 'ready' status
- [ ] Test notification for 'completed' status
- [ ] Update admin UI labels if needed
- [ ] Test full order flow: pending → confirmed → processing → ready → completed

## 🎉 Done!

Once you run the SQL migration, all notifications will use the correct pickup-friendly language:

- ✅ "Order Ready for Pickup" (not "Shipped")
- ✅ "Order Completed" / "Picked Up" (not "Delivered")
- ✅ Clear, accurate messaging for your pickup-only business model

Your customers will now get clear, accurate notifications about their pickup orders! 🎊
