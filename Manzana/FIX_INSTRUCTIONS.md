# üîß Manzana App - Registration & Profile Data Fix

## Issues Fixed

1. **Account Creation Error**: "Database error saving new user"
2. **Profile Screen**: Can't fetch real user data
3. **Edit Profile Screen**: Can't fetch real user data

## Root Causes

- Missing Row Level Security (RLS) policies for user registration
- Database trigger not properly configured for automatic profile creation
- User profile creation logic was incomplete

## üöÄ How to Apply the Fix

### Step 1: Database Fix (REQUIRED)

1. Open your Supabase dashboard
2. Go to the SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the entire contents of `COMPLETE_DATABASE_FIX.sql`
4. Click "Run" to execute the script

This will:

- ‚úÖ Fix RLS policies for user registration
- ‚úÖ Create proper database trigger for automatic profile creation
- ‚úÖ Grant necessary permissions
- ‚úÖ Create profiles for any existing auth users without profiles

### Step 2: Test the Fix

Run the test script to verify everything works:

```bash
cd /Users/mharjadeenario/Desktop/Manzana-Collection/Manzana
node test-registration.js
```

### Step 3: Test in Your App

1. **Try creating a new account** - should work without "Database error"
2. **Check Profile Screen** - should show your real user data
3. **Check Edit Profile Screen** - should load your real data and allow updates

## üîç What Was Changed

### Database Changes

- Added comprehensive RLS policies for `users` table
- Created robust trigger function for automatic profile creation
- Fixed permissions for auth operations
- Added fallback profile creation for existing users

### App Code Changes

- Updated `useAuth.tsx` with better error handling and profile creation
- Added manual profile creation fallback if trigger fails
- Improved profile verification logic
- Enhanced error messages for better debugging

## üéØ Expected Results

After applying the fix:

- ‚úÖ **Account creation works** - no more "Database error saving new user"
- ‚úÖ **Profile screen shows real data** - name, email, user type, etc.
- ‚úÖ **Edit profile works** - can view and update profile information
- ‚úÖ **Better error handling** - clearer error messages if something goes wrong

## üö® Important Notes

1. **Run the SQL script first** - the database changes are required for the app fixes to work
2. **Existing users** - the script will create profiles for any auth users that don't have them
3. **Test thoroughly** - try creating accounts, signing in, and updating profiles

## üîß Troubleshooting

If you still have issues:

1. **Check Supabase logs** - look for any RLS policy violations
2. **Verify the trigger exists**:
   ```sql
   SELECT tgname FROM pg_trigger WHERE tgname = 'on_auth_user_created';
   ```
3. **Check RLS policies**:
   ```sql
   SELECT tablename, policyname FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'users';
   ```
4. **Run the test script** to diagnose connection issues

## üìù Files Modified

- `COMPLETE_DATABASE_FIX.sql` - Database fix script (NEW)
- `src/hooks/useAuth.tsx` - Enhanced registration and profile logic
- `test-registration.js` - Test script to verify fixes (NEW)

## üéâ Success Indicators

You'll know the fix worked when:

- Registration completes without errors
- Profile screen shows your actual name and email
- Edit profile screen loads your data correctly
- You can update your profile information
